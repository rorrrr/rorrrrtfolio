  <h3> Self Employed Professional Online Poker Player/Coach (2010-2015)</h3>
  <p>
  I achieved a steady income and many accolades during this time, most notably, consistent finishes in the top #20 for yearly profit in the world for the particular game type in which I specialised. Demonstrating discipline, a strong work ethic and ambition to improve to be amongst the world’s best.
  <br></br>
  Coached 4 players of varying ability to improve their poker skill, both technically and mentally. Learned what it takes to be a leader and teacher and how to pass on knowledge and skills effectively and constructively. Creating instructional videos as well as one to one coaching. All 4 went on to show improved profits. 
  <br></br>
  During this time, I amassed a database of over 2 million hands. Trend and data analysis was performed using an SQL based poker analytics software called Hold’em Manager. This software allowed me to become proficient with SQL and constantly strive to improve via this tool to maximise earnings.
